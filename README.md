Hi there,

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I work on several private repositories related to location services. While you can't see these projects directly, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate.

- I’m currently working on private projects involving Java, NodeJS, Python, SpringBoot, javascript and React.
- I’m getting seniority on Django and Flask.

You can contact me via pasardinha@sapo.pt or https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-sardinha-5a85502b/.

Thank you for visiting!
